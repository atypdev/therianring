# Scripts
## move_site.ps1
The `move_site.ps1` file is responsible for the automation of the Jekyll site building and deployment process. It checks for elevated privileges, builds the Jekyll site, and moves the site contents to the Apache htdocs directory. It ensures a seamless workflow by handling permission checks, build success verification, and the transfer of updated site content to the appropriate location.

> Note: Previous scripts such as the install script were removed for bugs.
